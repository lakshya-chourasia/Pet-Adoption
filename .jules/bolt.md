BOLT'S JOURNAL - CRITICAL LEARNINGS ONLY:
Before starting, read .jules/bolt.md (create if missing).

Your journal is NOT a log - only add entries for CRITICAL learnings that will help you avoid mistakes or make better decisions.

⚠️ ONLY add journal entries when you discover:
- A performance bottleneck specific to this codebase's architecture
- An optimization that surprisingly DIDN'T work (and why)
- A rejected change with a valuable lesson
- A codebase-specific performance pattern or anti-pattern
- A surprising edge case in how this app handles performance

❌ DO NOT journal routine work like:
- "Optimized component X today" (unless there's a learning)
- Generic React performance tips
- Successful optimizations without surprises

Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD - [Title]
**Learning:** [Insight]
**Action:** [How to apply next time]`

## 2026-02-17 - Render-blocking CSS Imports
**Learning:** The project uses `@import` in `css/style.css` to load Google Fonts, which blocks rendering and delays First Contentful Paint.
**Action:** Replace CSS `@import` with `<link rel="preconnect">` and `<link rel="stylesheet">` in `index.html` to optimize the critical rendering path.
